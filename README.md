**Advanced User Data Feature - Overview:**

The advanced "User Data" feature in the Java system is designed to enhance the user experience in programs similar to social networking sites. It focuses on providing efficient and advanced capabilities for data management, forming an integral part of improving the core system. This empowers users to exercise complete and effective control over all their data within the program.

**"data" File:**
- The source code for this feature is available in a file named "data."

**For New Users:**

**Export and Deletion Management:**

*Users can manage their data effectively with enhanced export and deletion options, tailoring the process to their preferences.*

**Data Export Options:**
Users now have the flexibility to choose how they want to download their data directly from the program. The export process allows users to either download individual PDF files containing their user data or opt for a compressed file that includes all PDF files.

**Deletion Options:**
Two types of deletion are available:

1. **Hard Delete:**
   - With hard delete, users can permanently remove their entire account. Once a hard delete is performed, the user cannot recreate an account with the same username in the future.

2. **Soft Delete:**
   - Soft delete empowers users to selectively remove specific types of data from their profile. Users can choose which data categories they want to delete.


**Design Patterns Utilized:**
1. **Singleton Pattern**
2. **Strategy Pattern**
3. **Decorator Pattern**
4. **Factory Pattern**
5. **In addition, the Application of SOLID Principles has been utilized.**

*This feature is designed to enhance user privacy and provide effective data management in a secure, standards-compliant environment.*
